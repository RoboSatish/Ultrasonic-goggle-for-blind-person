# Ultrasonic-goggle-for-blind-person
 This device includes a pair of glasses and an obstacle detection module fitted in it in the center, a processing unit, an output device i.e. a beeping component, and a power supply. The Obstacle detection module and the output device is connected to the processing unit. The power supply is used to supply power to the central processing unit. The obstacle detection module basically consists of a ultrasonic sensor, processing unit consist of a control module and the output unit consists of a buzzer. The control unit controls the ultrasonic sensors and gets the information of the obstacle present in front of the man and processes the information and sends the output through the buzzer accordingly. These Ultrasonic Smart Glasses for Blind people is a portable device, easy to use, light weight, user friendly and cheap in price. These glasses could easily guide the blind people and help them avoid obstacles.

# Objective

The main objective of our present work is to provide a reliable, cost effective, low power solution for a blind people which would help them to move almost like any other normal pedestrian. The cost of this system makes it affordable for the majority of the society which in turn an effective device for them to spend on, just for once and assures wonderful travel guidance for them
